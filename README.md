# Data Source:
All these data sets are made up of data from the US government's website called The World Factbook containing information for each country.

# Project Goals:
To gain insights into similarity between countries and regions of the world through exploratory data analysis and by experimenting with different clusters of countries. The key focus is to think about what these clusters actually represent when segmenting the world's nations into different groups (clusters) based on data alone.
